**Cyclic Redundancy Check**

 
 -> Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error detection method.
    It is based on binary division.
    
 -> CRC uses Generator Polynomial which is available on both sender and receiver side.
 
 HERE, IN THE OUTPUT,
 
 -> the message send is 100100
    the key value or the generator polynomial is 1101.
    
 -> On the sender's side, this data is divided by the key valur and we get the reminder as 001.
 
 -> 001 is the CRC.
 
 _> This remainder 001 is then augmented with the data, the encoded data sent become 100100001.
 
 -> Code word received at the receiver side is now 100100001.
 
 -> (a) part of the output (NO ERROR)
    Now the receiver side will check the remainder which is all zeroes now, i.e, there was no error in transmisson.
 
 -> (b) part of the output (ERROR DETECTED)
    Now in Noisy Channel,
    If the receiver got the code word as 100000001, the remainder will become 011, which means there was error in transmisson.
