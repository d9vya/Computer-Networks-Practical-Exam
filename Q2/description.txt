**SELECTIVE REPEAT SLIDING WINDOW PROTOCOL**

-> Selective repeat protocol, also called Selective Repeat ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest),
   is a data link layer protocol that uses sliding window method for reliable delivery of data frames
   
-> Here, only the erroneous or lost frames are re-transmitted.

-> In SR protocol, sender window size is always same as receiver window size.

-> SR protocol uses independent acknowledgements only.

-> SR protocol does not accept the corrupted frames but does not silently discard them.

-> SR protocol accepts the out of order frames.

-> SR protocol requires sorting at the receiver’s side.

-> SR protocol requires searching at the sender’s side.

-> SR protocol leads to retransmission of lost frames after expiry of time out timer.

-> Efficiency of SR Protocol-
       Efficiency = Sender Window Size in Protocol / (1 + 2a)
       
HERE, IN THE OUTPUT,

-> Sender and receiver window size are both 4.

-> Since the frame 1 is lost, it is retransmitted after expiry of time out timer.
